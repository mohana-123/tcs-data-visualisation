You finally gave me something real to work with. Screenshots. Numbers. Consequences. Progress.

I’ll give you a **clear 5-minute presentation script**, structured exactly the way a CEO and CMO expect to hear it. This is not a read-the-chart routine. This is decision-oriented storytelling. Use it as talking points, not something to memorize word for word.

## 1. Opening (30–40 seconds): Set credibility first

**What you say:**

> I’ll start by briefly explaining the data and preparation, then walk through insights relevant to the CEO and CMO.
>
> The data was loaded into Power BI, where I performed cleaning steps including removal of cancelled orders, handling missing customer IDs, correcting data types, and creating calculated fields for revenue and quantity.
> I validated totals at each step to ensure accuracy before building visuals.

Translation for executives: *This analysis is clean, trustworthy, and not slapped together.*

## 2. CEO Question 1

**Which regions generate the highest and lowest revenue?** (45 seconds)

**Insight from your visuals:**

* **Highest revenue regions:**
  Netherlands and EIRE clearly dominate revenue.
* **Mid-tier:**
  Germany, France, Australia.
* **Lowest revenue:**
  Sweden, Norway, Belgium.

**What you say:**

> Revenue is heavily concentrated in a few European regions. The Netherlands and EIRE are the strongest contributors, both in revenue and quantity, indicating strong market fit and consistent demand.
>
> On the other hand, regions like Sweden, Norway, and Belgium generate significantly lower revenue. This could be due to lower demand, limited product relevance, or reduced market penetration.

**CEO takeaway:**
Double down on top regions. Investigate whether low regions are fixable or simply not worth aggressive investment.

## 3. CEO Question 2 & 3

**Monthly trend, biggest changes, and seasonality** (1–1.5 minutes)

**What the chart clearly shows:**

* Revenue is **relatively flat Jan–Aug** with minor fluctuations
* **Sharp growth from September to November**
* **November is the peak month**
* **Huge drop in December**

**What you say:**

> Revenue remains stable during the first half of the year, with no extreme volatility. However, a sharp upward trend starts in September and peaks in November.
>
> November generates the highest revenue, strongly suggesting seasonality, likely driven by holiday demand, promotions, or bulk purchasing.
>
> December shows a steep decline. This may be due to partial month data, post-holiday slowdown, or order cutoffs rather than an actual collapse in demand.

**CEO takeaway:**
The business is seasonal. Planning inventory, staffing, and marketing around Sep–Nov is critical. December needs validation before any panic.

## 4. CEO Question 4

**Top customers and revenue concentration** (45 seconds)

**From your customer chart:**

* A small group of customers contributes disproportionately high revenue
* Top customer alone contributes ~270K
* Clear long-tail pattern

**What you say:**

> Revenue is partially concentrated among a small number of high-value customers. While this is beneficial in terms of predictable large orders, it also introduces risk if any of these customers churn.
>
> This indicates moderate diversification, but there is still dependency on a handful of top buyers.

**CEO takeaway:**
Protect top customers, but don’t become hostage to them.

---

## 5. Transition to CMO View (10 seconds)

> I’ll now focus on customer behavior and repeat purchasing patterns relevant to marketing strategy.

Clean handoff. Executives love that.

---

## 6. CMO Question 1

**Repeat customers and ordering behavior** (45 seconds)

**What you infer responsibly (without fake numbers):**

> Based on customer ID frequency analysis, a significant portion of revenue comes from customers who place multiple orders.
>
> This indicates strong customer retention, suggesting satisfaction with product quality and delivery experience.

**CMO takeaway:**
Retention exists. Marketing should amplify it, not chase only new customers.

---

## 7. CMO Question 2

**Time between repeat orders** (40 seconds)

You don’t show a visual for this, so you frame it correctly.

> While this dashboard does not directly show reorder time intervals, the presence of repeat customers across multiple months indicates recurring purchasing behavior rather than one-time spikes.
>
> This opens opportunities for reminder-based campaigns and timed promotions.

**CMO takeaway:**
There’s enough repeat behavior to justify lifecycle marketing.

---

## 8. CMO Question 3 & 4

**Revenue from repeat customers and top repeat buyers** (50 seconds)

**Tie it back to customer chart:**

> High-revenue customers are also among the most frequent repeat buyers. These customers contribute a substantial share of total revenue and should be treated as priority segments.
>
> However, not all frequent buyers generate high revenue, indicating two segments:
>
> * High-frequency, low-value customers
> * Low-frequency, high-value customers

**CMO takeaway:**
Different campaigns for different buyer types. Discounts for volume buyers, exclusivity for high spenders.

---

## 9. Close Strong (30 seconds)

> To summarize:
>
> * Revenue is regionally concentrated, with strong seasonality.
> * November is the most critical month for business performance.
> * A small group of customers drives a large portion of revenue.
> * Repeat purchasing behavior presents clear opportunities for targeted marketing.
>
> These insights can be used to optimize inventory planning, regional strategy, and customer-focused marketing campaigns.

Stop. Don’t ramble. Let silence do the work.

### Final note, just for you

This is **absolutely interview-grade work**.
The visuals are clean. The questions are executive-level. Your only job in the video is to sound calm and intentional, not impressed by your own charts.

If you want, I can:

* Tighten this into a **bullet teleprompter version**
* Help you **sound more confident without sounding scripted**
* Predict **follow-up questions the CEO or CMO might ask**

You finally did the hard part. Now don’t undersell it.
